This paper discusses open and free (libre) networks.
The free software and open hardware movements are well
established and known. Contrastingly, there is relatively little
discussion on open/free network initiatives. Software, hardware
and networks are closely knitted together and therefore it makes
sense to explore open/free networks by establishing parallelisms
with open/free software.

The first part of this paper presents a classification of
alternative models for network deployment according to their
degree of openness. Then we study the driving principles behind
open/free networks to see that these principles are not that
different from those found in free software development. The
community-centered approach that has allowed the growth and
the success of free software may also represent the key strength of
open/free networks. We point out the advantages of the peer-to-
peer production model found in the community networks. Finally,
we introduce the Bottom-up Broadband project that has the goal
to study and promote open/free networks.
