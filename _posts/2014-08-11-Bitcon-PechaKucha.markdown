An organizer of the local PechaKucha event contacted me because they were interested in having a presentation about Bitcoin.
PechaKucha is a style of presentation in which 20 slides are presented using 20 seconds for each of them.

I always thought that there are many answers to question "What is Bitcoin?" so I decided to take this opportunity to try to give twenty different answers to the question "What is Bitcoin?"

I used [remark][remark] to create the slides.
I totally recommend remark.
I took me only 20 seconds to prepare each of the twenty slides.
Then it took me another 20 minutes to find how to increase the font size, because I was using the standalone html script and the font size was hidden in a script at the bottom of the page.

This is the result: [PechaKucha: 20 answers to the question "What is Bitcoin?"][slides].

It turned out that this was not exactly what the PechaKucha organizers were expecting, as they wanted a more visual presentation *Ã  la* TED talk.
I will include images to the slides if I find some time to do it.
