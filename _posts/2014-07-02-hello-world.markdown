I like the idea of being able to write a blog in my favourite text editor. I also feel that I should keep some kind of public record of some of my activities, even if it is only a small selection for illustrative purposes. I came across [Jekyll][jekyll] and I learned about its smooth integration with [github][github] and I decided to give it a try. This is my first post. Hello world.
